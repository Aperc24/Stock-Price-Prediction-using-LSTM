# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique, a powerful deep learning model suitable for time series data.

## Workflow

The project follows these steps:

1. **Understanding the problem statement and data requirements**  
   Define the scope of the problem and identify the type of data required for stock price prediction.

2. **Gathering the data**  
   Use the [Yahoo Finance (YFinance) API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) to collect stock data for the selected company.

3. **Importing the necessary libraries**  
   Import essential Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, and others required for data processing and modeling.

4. **Exploring the data**  
   Analyze the stock data to understand price movements over time by focusing on:
   - Closing price
   - Volume
   - Moving averages
   - Calculating returns

5. **Preparing the training and test datasets**  
   Split the data into training and test sets for model development and evaluation. Perform data normalization or scaling if necessary.

6. **Building the LSTM model**  
   Create and train the LSTM model to capture patterns in the stock price data.

7. **Evaluating the model**  
   Assess the model's performance using suitable metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

8. **Using the model to predict stock prices**  
   Utilize the trained LSTM model to predict future stock prices and visualize the results.
